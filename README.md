# LiebraryREST

Liebrary rest is a demo project made only for educational purposes. The Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy aims to provide several (but not all) REST services to manage a fake library with books, authors and users.
The application doesn't provide creational services (like inserting new books, authors or even users) a part from the booking service.

### What is not
It's not a real project with all services needed and it's not, obviously, a production ready project.
